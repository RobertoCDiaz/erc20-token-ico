# ERC-20 Token ICO

A project that launches a brand new cryptocoin using the ERC-20 standard for tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain.

## Project requirements.

* There should be a limit on how many token there are available. This must be provided as an argument when deploying the token smart contract.
* Every WNC NFT holder should get 10 tokens for free, having in mind that they would pay for the gas fees.
* The price of one token at the time of ICO must be also provided as an argument to the contract deployment, and should be in terms of $ETH.
* Build a website which users can visit for the ICO.
